Flash memory, like ROM is non-volatile and like RAM it can be written to.
Flash memory was developed from the type of ROM called ‘electrically erasable programmable read only memory’ (EEPROM) as mentioned above and was introduced in 1984.
EEPROMs had to be completely erased before they could be written to, but flash memory can be written to and read in small blocks.

Flash memory consists of transistors that keep their charge even when the power is switched off called floating gate transistors.  (Normal transistors lose their state when the power is turned off).
At first, all transistors are charged (set to 1). But when a save operation begins, current is blocked to some transistors, switching them to 0

Flash memory can be used to for the functions usually carried out by ROM but is slower than RAM and is not used for main memory.

Its main use is in secondary storage devices such as SD cards, USB memory sticks and in SSDs (solid state drives) which increasingly being used as the main storage devices in laptops. They are called solid state storage devices because they have no moving parts and are ideal for mobile devices.

You will be looking at the advantages and uses of flash memory in section 1.3. Storage.
