Flash memory is a type of secondary storage that can be re-written. Flash memory is portable and compatible with many modern devices such as cameras, mobile phones and USB. The reason why flash memory is portable due to the fact that it is solid state, meaning that the data is electronically programmed onto the circuits. An advantage of solid state over storing data on a magnetic hard drive is that there are no moving parts and can be transported easier and the access speeds are much faster too.
