RAM consists of billions of storage locations each of which can store a byte of data and each has an address so that the CPU knows where to store (write) and retrieve (read) data and instructions.

RAM is ‘random access’ because each memory location can be accessed in any order if the ‘address’ of that location is specified. This speeds up data retrieval as the CPU can go to any location in any order. Serial access means it would have to start each time at the first location and go through them in order until it finds the correct one. Digital tape storage is random access.

Data can be read from and also written to RAM. It is used to store instructions and data. The contents of RAM are therefore constantly changing as a program is running.

RAM is said to be volatile because if there is no electrical power then the RAM will lose all of its data.
