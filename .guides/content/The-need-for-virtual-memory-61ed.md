Typical RAM size in modern computing is between 4GB and 8GB. As programs are becoming more complex and the need for running multiple programs more prevalent, RAM can be taken up quite quickly. When RAM is full, rather than the computer crashing when new instructions are needed to be stored, the CPU uses the hard drive to act as RAM. This use of the hard drive to act as RAM is called virtual memory.
