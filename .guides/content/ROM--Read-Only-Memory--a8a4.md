Read-only memory (ROM) is an integrated circuit on a chip. It is programmed with specific data to perform a particular function when it is manufactured.

ROM data cannot be changed – hence the name ‘read only’ – but it is non-volatile and retains the data when the power is removed.

Read-only memory is most commonly used to store system-level programs required by the computer to function that are needed at all times. 
The most common example is the system BIOS program, which is stored in ROM. Having this in a permanent ROM means it is available when the power is turned on so that the PC can use it to boot up the system.
