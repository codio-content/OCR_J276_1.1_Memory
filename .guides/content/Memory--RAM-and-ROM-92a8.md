In this lesson we will look at computer memory and the purpose of RAM and ROM in a computer system.

### Computer memory

Computer memory is any physical device in a computer that can store program instructions and data.
The primary memory or main memory is internal to the computer and can be directly accessed by the CPU.
The word 'main' is used to distinguish it from storage devices such as hard disk drives which are called secondary or secondary storage devices.
