When the power is turned off the instructions that are held in the RAM memory locations disappear and new instructions are loaded during next use. This method of wiping clean the memory locations when the power is turned off is called volatile memory. ROM is a permanent store of instructions that when power is turned off and turned back on again will remain. We say that ROM is non-volatile because the contents remain when power is turned back on.
